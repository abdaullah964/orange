    <h1>Petra</h1>
    <p>Inhabited since prehistoric times, this <b>Nabataean</b> caravan-city, situated between the Red Sea and the <b>Dead Sea</b>, was an important crossroads between Arabia, Egypt and Syria-Phoenicia. Petra is half-built, half-carved into the rock, and is surrounded by mountains riddled with passages and gorges. It is one of the world's most famous archaeological sites, where ancient <b>Eastern</b> traditions blend with <b>Hellenistic</b> architecture.
